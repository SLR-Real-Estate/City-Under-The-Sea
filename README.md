Valuation of Karachi's Real Estate Threatened by Climate Change

The project contains the following components: Estimation of value of houses in Khi per square area unit and determining which areas of Khi are under threat by climate change. For the former, we want to scrape data from Zameen.com on houses in Karachi and use that data for estimating the value of real estate per square unit area. For the latter, we want to be able to see on satellite images the area of Khi that is under threat, extract the number of houses included in the threatened area, and for each house calculate the area. 

The two components of the project described above live in their own folders: Estimating Value Per Square Unit Area and Extracting Houses Under Threat. Each folder in itself contains readme files and programming files used to accomplish sub-tasks.
