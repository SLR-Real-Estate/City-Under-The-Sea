This folder contains scripts and resources related to extracting information on each house that is under threat from sea level rise and its area. 

There's a few components to this task: Setting up training data to train a model using machine learning to identify boundaries of houses on satellite images,
using the trained model to predict/segment satellite image data for Karachi into houses marked with clear boundaries, superimposing layers of predicted 
sea level rises over current satellite image data, extract the area for each clearly demarcated house that falls in the intersection of predicted sea level
rise and Karachi's satellite image data.
